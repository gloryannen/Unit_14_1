Part One: Solidify Terminology
In your own terms, define the following terms:

What is HTTP?
A protocol that allows communication between browsers and servers in the form of text, sound, images, ect.

What is a URL?
A web address that consists of multiple parts suchs as protocols, hostname, port, paths named resources, and queries.

What is DNS?
Turns IP addresses into a more readable name called domain name services which makes it easier for users to type and remember.

What is a query string?
Is a resource/path that provides information such as searched terms or other data.

What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
GET - Are requests that don't change server data and are normally sent using a header.
POST - Are requests that change server data and are normally sent using a body.

What is an HTTP request?
A request in the form of a URL made by a client to a server attempting to access information on that server.

What is an HTTP response?
Server response to the client that contains the content or information requested by that client.

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
Information with values passed via a HTTP request or response.

What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
The browser looks up the IP for the DNS, makes a connection and requests from the server. The server then responds with the information or content that is then loaded into the client's browser.
